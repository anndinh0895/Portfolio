                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    Existing scheduling apps require manual input which cause users to stray away from using these services since it is time consuming and hard to keep up with.
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    Aja is a scheduling app that integrates an AI system to provide users with a personal assistant to help with creating their daily tasks and to help meet their goals.

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    My team and I conducted 18 user interviews and sent out a survey that resulted in 14 responses.

                    <br><br><b><i>Objectives</i></b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand the user’s thoughts/feelings towards AI powered apps and the utilization of AI</li>

                <div class="PortCenterGrid2">Instead of a journey map, collectively we decided on a storyboard where we followed Ruby's painpoints to better understand the users' needs. <br><br> The story begins with Ruby having a tough time staying organized. After some quality time with her friend, she received advice to try Aja. As we follow through her story, we can see that the app helps her sort out her daily tasks and activities. And as a result, solves her organization issue. </div>

                    <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
                    My team and I took some time to write down a few ideas we had for the app that aligned with our objectives. After we finished brainstorming, we begin to sort out the ideas. Using the feature prioritization matrix and the data we took from our research, we ended up with the following chart:
                    <br><img src="../images/aja_img05.png" width="600" class="center">

                    <h3>Ruby's User Flow</h3>
                    Following the decision of features, my team and I worked on the user flow. We knew the main features we wanted to focus on were: utilizing AI to add a task to the calendar, using AI to move missed tasks to another day, and adding a mood feature. Since these tasks required many steps, the project leader split up the user flow between team members. I helped created the task flow for signing up.

                    <h3>Low-Fi Prototype</h3>
                    After we had an idea of how our task flow would look like, my team and I drew 3 different sketches and collaborated together to mesh our ideas to create Aja. 

                    <h3>Mid-Fi Prototype</h3>
                    Due to time constraint, we immediately went into Mid-Fi prototyping and testing. I conducted a 6 usuability testings and collectively as a team we had a total of 15 usability testings. <br><br>Through this we found that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users could not locate add task </li>
                        <li>Too much information</li>
                        <li>Add task button too small</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>UI Style Guide</h3>
                    Before we could make the appropriate changes, my team and I created different versions of the app using colorings that we felt worked well together. After voting on the best color palette, we decided to go with the one I designed. I conducted color accessibility tests to ensure that everything was accessible for the users. <br><br>

                    Although I organized the schedule for our project, we fell behind. With only 3 days left, the project manager decided that we could only conduct one usability testing. As a result, we could not do the iterations in time for the presentation. However, my team and I did work on the prototype the night prior to finish all of the interations mentioned below.

As stated, there was a time constraint which made it difficult for us to create a well polished project. Despite the issue, the team worked well together and communicated effectively.

                        <li>Incorporate budgeting with an additional security measures in place</li>
