                    My team and I conducted 6 user interviews with current college students who live on campus in fraternities and sororities. In addition to the user interviews, we also conducted an online survey to cover more people across the country that revealed that students had an issue with trash was missed.
                    
                    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                    There is an opportunity to increase education and awareness on trash waste disposal as well as provide better solutions.

                    Darius Miller, a 21-year-old residing in a lively frat house, grapples with the challenge of maintaining order amidst epic parties. As he navigates the ups and downs of college life, Darius wants to focus on balancing the joys of youthful celebration with the need for a clean and welcoming environment.

                    Following the decision of features, I worked on the user flow for the main tasks with another team member.

                    <h3>Low-Fi Prototype</h3>
                    To delegate tasks and make the work more efficient, we each worked on separate prototypes of different levels. I drew the low-fi prototype and wireframed it according to what our user flow suggested.

                    I instructed a team member to do the mid-fi prototype and we conducted our first round of usability testings utilizing this version. I tested 2 people on the mid-fi and as a team we had a total of 5 tests. 
                    <br><br>Through this we found that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users wanted a way to opt out of the tutorial</li>
                        <li>Wanted a back button</li>
                        <li>Needed a way to go between each tabs</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 style="text-align:center;">UI Style Guide</h3>
                    This was the first project we did within our class so we did not have a style guide. However, one of the team members created the logo for Greek Clean and we created a color palette using the logo instead. We collectively agreed that green was the perfect color since it is supposed to represent clean and earth.

                <div class="PortLeftGrid4"><h3>Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>

                    After discussing the iterations with my team members, we went to working on the iterations. Each one taking on a different task to be more efficient. We changed the prototype to ensure users could navigate between tabs. We also gave the option for users to opt out of the tutorial. In addition, we added tabs for users to go back. Before our presentation, we did conduct 2 more usabiltiy testing to see if our users could easily navigate and it was a success!

                <div class="PortCenterGrid2">Due to my time management skills, the project ran very efficiently. Despite the lack of communication from several team members, we learned to make it work. I learned pivotal leadership skills through this project since it was hard to manage team members that hardly showed up. Utltimately alignment was found and the project was completed without any major complications.

                    I imagine that the app can grow to implement:

                        <li>Chapter management</li>
                        <li>Exclusive deals and discounts</li>
