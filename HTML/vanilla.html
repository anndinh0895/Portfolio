                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    Their current website lacks responsive web design, there are some unreliable buttons, outdated information, and design that is not accessible. There are opportunities to improve the design of the website to improve the experience of the users and improve business outcomes.
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    Redesign the Village Baking Co. website to improve navigation and usability.

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    Before interviewing users, my team and I sent out a screener survey to gather insight. We wanted to target people who like to treat themselves frequently by going to a bakery or coffee shop. After the survey, I conducted 2 in-person user interviews and all together as a team, we had a total of 6 interviews. One of the team members also interviewed one of the stakeholders. 

                    <br><br><b><i>Objectives</i></b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand their perception of the brand and Village Baking Co.</li>
                        <li>Understand the experience with the website</li>
                        <li>Identify pain points and opportunities for improvement</li>
                        <li>Identify what users want from the website</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <br><b><i>Survey Results</i></b>
                    <br><br>The survey showed us what their users do and expect out of a bakery. The main highlight was that most users visit the website before going to the actual location. With this in mind, we aimed to better the user/customer experience by narrowing our focus on what the user needs
                    to see. 
                     

                    <br><br><b><i>Affinity Diagram</i></b>
                    <br><br>My team and I put our data from our interviews onto sticky notes on Figjam and separated their pain points into reachable goals for the redesign. A significant takeaway was the overall readibility of the website and menu system. <br><br>

                    To better understand the flow of the website, we created a user flow of the current page. From there we created categories of each navigation to conduct a card sorting activity. As a team we sorted it the cards on our own to get a better idea of how the users would categorize each subsection. Afterwards we had 3 different people do the same. Once we had an idea of how the redesigned website should work, I directed two team members to create the site map.

                    To be efficient with time, I split up the roles for the ideation procress. I took the time to sketch a few ideas of what the website would look like based on the inspiration and moodboard that we created. Once done, I shared the sketches within the team chat and we all voted on the best options.
                
                    <h3>UI Style Guide</h3>
                    As the other team members were working on their roles, I had delegated for another team member to work on the UI Style Guide based on our findings. We had agreed upon not changing too much of the company's brand and tone because that is what they wanted to represent. However, we did change the font and colors that did not originally pass the color accessibility test. <br><br>

                    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Mid-Fi Prototype and Usability Testing</h3>
                    Once the project leader returned, we all worked on the Mid-Fi Prototype together. Each person taking on a different page to create. Despite the roles being dispersed, the mid-fi prototype came together flawlessly. After the prototype was created, we conducted 6 usability testings.
                    <br><br>Through this we found that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Footer content should be distributed in the space</li>
                        <li>Multiple screens for locations for easier readabiltiy</li>
                        <li>Social media icons as links</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 style="text-align:center;">A/B Testing</h3>
                    One important finding that we noted was that there was a mix of emotions towards the menu page. We had half of the users state that they loved the usage of all the images for the menu while the other half felt overwhelmed by the amount of information thrown at them. So as a result we agreed on doing an A/B Testing where one prototype showed the original mid-fi we created and the other prototype showcased a dropdown menu of just text. <br><br>We found that although option A was more memorable, the majority of the users preferred option B.<br><br>

                    With the results of the A/B usuability testings in mind, we got to working on the changes for the Hi-Fi prototype. Aside from the menu, we also made iterations to the career page, location position, dividing the jobs based on location, and we cleaned up the look by removing components that did not serve the user.

                    I imagine that if granted the time and resources, the website can be improved to have:
                    <ul>
                        <li>An FAQ page that includes information about allergens and dietary needs</li>

                        <li>An updated menu page that allows user to hover over text to view the images</li>
